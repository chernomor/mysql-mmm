MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts to perform monitoring/failover and management of MySQL Master-Master replication configurations (with only one node writable at any time). The toolset also has the ability to read balance standard master/slave configurations with any number of slaves, so you can use it to move virtual IP addresses around a group of servers depending on whether they are behind in replication.
