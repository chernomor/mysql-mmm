@node mmm_control
@chapter @command{mmm_control} - controlling the monitor
@cindex mmm_control

The monitor daemon may be controlled with the help of @command{mmm_control}. If you have multiple clusters, you should always specify the name of the cluster you want to work with (i.e. to check C1 status, use "mmm_control @@C1 show"). Otherwise - if you have only one MMM cluster, it can be used without cluster name.

@section @code{help}
@cindex help
Show help message.
@section @code{ping}
Ping the monitor deamon to check if it's still alive.

@example
# mmm_control ping
OK: Pinged successfully!
@end example

@noindent
When the monitor is down:

@example
# mmm_control ping
ERROR: Can't connect to monitor daemon!
@end example

@section @code{show}
@cindex show
Show the current cluster status. See @ref{States} for an explanation of the different node states.

@node set_online
@section @code{set_online @var{host}}
@cindex set_online
@code{set_online} is used to recover a node from a failure when it's state is 
@code{AWAITING_RECOVERY} or @code{ADMIN_OFFLINE}. In the following example, 
the host db2 was rebooted. Here's the cluster status:

@smallexample
# mmm_control show
  db1(192.168.0.31) master/ONLINE. Roles: writer(192.168.0.50), reader(192.168.0.51)
  db2(192.168.0.32) master/AWAITING_RECOVERY. Roles:
  db3(192.168.0.33) slave/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.52), reader(192.168.0.53)
@end smallexample

@noindent
All roles have been moved to hosts db1 and db3 as db2 has failed. Now that it's recovered, we should set it online:
@smallexample
# mmm_control set_online db2
OK: State of 'db2' changed to ONLINE. Now you can wait some time and check its new roles!

# mmm_control show
  db1(192.168.0.31) master/ONLINE. Roles: writer(192.168.0.50), reader(192.168.0.51)
  db2(192.168.0.32) master/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.52)
  db3(192.168.0.33) slave/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.53)
@end smallexample


@node set_offline
@section @code{set_offline @var{host}}
@cindex set_offline
@code{set_offline} is used to bring a node down manually for maintenance. This will remove all roles and stop replication.

@smallexample
# mmm_control show
  db1(192.168.0.31) master/ONLINE. Roles: writer(192.168.0.50), reader(192.168.0.51)
  db2(192.168.0.32) master/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.52)
  db3(192.168.0.33) slave/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.53)

# mmm_control set_offline db1
OK: State of 'db1' changed to ADMIN_OFFLINE. Now you can wait some time and check all roles!

mon:~# mmm_control show
  db1(192.168.0.31) master/ADMIN_OFFLINE. Roles:
  db2(192.168.0.32) master/ONLINE. Roles: writer(192.168.0.50), reader(192.168.0.52)
  db3(192.168.0.33) slave/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.51), reader(192.168.0.53)
@end smallexample

@noindent
@code{set_online} is used to bring the node back online again. See @ref{set_online}.

@section @code{mode}
Print current mode. In the following example, the monitor is running in @code{ACTIVE} mode:

@example
# mmm_control mode
ACTIVE
@end example

@noindent
Here the monitor is in @code{PASSIVE} mode:

@example
# mmm_control mode
PASSIVE
@end example

@noindent
See @ref{Modes}.

@section @code{set_active}
Switch the monitor into @code{ACTIVE} mode:

@example
# mmm_control set_active
OK: Switched into active mode.
@end example

@noindent
See @ref{Modes}.

@section @code{set_manual}
Switch the monitor into @code{MANUAL} mode:

@example
# mmm_control set_manual
OK: Switched into manual mode.
@end example

@noindent
See @ref{Modes}.

@section @code{set_passive}
Switch the monitor into @code{PASSIVE} mode:

@example
# mmm_control set_passive
OK: Switched into passive mode.
@end example

@noindent
See @ref{Modes}.

@section @code{move_role @var{role} @var{host}}
Used to move an exclusive role between the cluster nodes. This command is not available in @code{PASSIVE} mode. Lets assume the following situation:

@smallexample
# mmm_control show
  db1(192.168.0.31) master/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.51)
  db2(192.168.0.32) master/ONLINE. Roles: writer(192.168.0.50), reader(192.168.0.52)
  db3(192.168.0.33) slave/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.53)
@end smallexample

@noindent
We use move_role to move the role @code{writer} to host db1:
@smallexample
# mmm_control move_role writer db1
OK: Role 'writer' has been moved from 'db2' to 'db1'. Now you can wait some time and check new roles info!

# mmm_control show
  db1(192.168.0.31) master/ONLINE. Roles: writer(192.168.0.50), reader(192.168.0.51)
  db2(192.168.0.32) master/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.52)
  db3(192.168.0.33) slave/ONLINE. Roles: reader(192.168.0.53)
@end smallexample

@section @code{move_role --force @var{role} @var{host}}
Can be used to move the @var{active_master_role} to a host with state @code{REPLICATION_FAIL} or @code{REPLICATION_DELAY}. Use this with caution! This command is not available in @code{PASSIVE} mode.

@section @code{set_ip @var{ip} @var{host}}
@code{set_ip} can be used to manipulate the roles in @code{PASSIVE} mode. The changes won't be applied until the monitor is switched into @code{ACTIVE} or @code{manual} mode via @code{set_active} or @code{set_manual}.
