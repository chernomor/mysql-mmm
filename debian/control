Description: MySQL Multi-Master Replication Manager common files.
 MMM (MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager) is a set of flexible scripts 
 to perform monitoring/failover and management of MySQL Master-Master 
 replication configurations (with only one node writable at any time). 
 The toolset also has the ability to read balance standard master/slave 
 configurations with any number of slaves, so you can use it to move virtual 
 IP addresses around a group of servers depending on whether they are behind 
 in replication. 
 .
 This package includes files needed by the agent, the monitor and the lvmtools.
